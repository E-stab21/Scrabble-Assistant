# Scrabble-Assistant
The source code for my 2024 UVM CS fair project.
Final.py is the code submitted for the project, while Scabble_but_better.py is
an alternative version of it that I made after the fair was over. This other version, unlike the first version,
looks at every possible legal word the user can place, rather than only for a certain section of the board,
and calculates the highest-scoring one.
